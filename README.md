# A Java8 HelloWorld template using gradle and kotlin

This is a template to help people get started faster when trying to build a javafx application using Java8 and Kotlin.

For more information about the gradle tasks, please go to https://github.com/FibreFoX/javafx-gradle-plugin to have more information.

For a quick build use:

`gradle run` - For running the application

`gradle jfxJar` - For creating a jar file

`gradle jfxNative` - For creating a native executable with the runtime bundled. Please go to the plugin repo for more information.

Have fun.
